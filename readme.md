# OregonTrailRemake
<h2>OregonTrailRemake</h2>
<h4>During the software development bootcamp, our group practiced used AI prompt tools to make an Oregon Trail remake with python.</h4>

<h4>Although maybe I'd want to finish this game, it would take away from the fact that it is a group effort so, maybe I'll make 'The Oregon Trail' in javascript in the future.</h4>
